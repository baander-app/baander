# Baander roadmap

Updated: 2026-10-26. This roadmap selects future work and records unresolved
acceptance. Current operating contracts belong in the linked guides; completed
milestones and their verification evidence remain in Git history.

## Resume here

Continue the Back-to-next-movie investigation through a newly reviewed, bounded
scope. Capture the browser failure and the next movie's actual startup outcome,
including its mounted/retry state, then complete authenticated cancellation and
recovery controls. The evidence below confirms retained producer ownership but
does not yet select a production remedy or another automatic test run.

Select other work for a concrete user workflow, demonstrated runtime gap or named
release decision. Historical unchecked items, old plan limitations and incomplete
experiments do not authorize implementation or indefinite reruns. Reconcile the
[retained plans](docs/plans/) with current callers before using them. Release gates
become actionable when their named environment, access or decision is available.

Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for workflow, [CONCEPTS.md](CONCEPTS.md) for shared terms
and the [testing guide](docs-book/part-2-developer-guide/testing.md) for current
runners and verification boundaries. Historical suite counts apply to their own
trees; they are not acceptance evidence for a new change.

## Playback investigation and evidence limits

**Movie departure:** Back closed the player, but three original producers retained
live ownership and renewed leases at a fixed cursor across 31 database samples
spanning 30.111 seconds. Native snapshots before and after that window showed the same three
stopped encoders. The next movie began admission, but the browser test exited
before its startup outcome, cancellation of the first movie or recovery could be
captured. Both diagnostic attempts remain nonpassing; both cleaned up successfully.

The detailed investigation remains in [Git history](#completed-work-and-evidence),
including the observer-timeout hypothesis and missing browser error evidence.
Receipts are under `var/test-runs/movie-departure-investigation`. Any later design
must resolve departure ownership, in-flight startup, rapid reopening and shared
sessions. Unconditional cancellation from React effect cleanup is not prescribed.

**Frame capture:** the historical native timestamp of 24.64 seconds versus a
24.60-second callback remains unexplained. Failure diagnostics are delivered:
63 Node tests and the prescribed two ordinary browser runs plus one sparse control
passed. The mismatch did not recur; these results do not prove its cause or
universal capture stability. The
[sparse playback guide](docs-book/part-2-developer-guide/testing.md#sparse-movie-playback)
retains the contract and evidence. No tolerance change or further implementation
is selected by this historical failure.

**Qualification boundaries:** bounded adaptation and endpoint proofs do not
establish uninterrupted full-source playback or universal format compatibility.
Keep these limits separate from selected work:

- Safari/native HLS, DASH browser playback and subtitles, full live FFmpeg DASH
  EOF, formal CMAF conformance, interactive audio switching, native caption-menu
  interaction and caption pixels remain unqualified. The
  [testing guide](docs-book/part-2-developer-guide/testing.md) distinguishes tested
  HLS/Chromium/Firefox workflows from these paths. The separate native pressure
  observer still expects the old HLS muxer output and is not qualified for the
  current demuxed output.
- General variable-rate gaps, timestamp discontinuities, additional origins,
  arbitrary containers, hardware and untested browser/format combinations remain
  outside the measured cases. A [Selected video endpoint](docs-book/part-2-developer-guide/testing.md#selected-video-endpoint-playback)
  is qualified only for its calibrated metadata paths; missing or stale metadata
  still uses an estimate. Existing checks do not establish general cache or
  performance qualification.
- Software colour checks qualify BT.2020 SDR handling and PQ/HLG tone mapping;
  they do not establish general HDR browser acceptance, complete reference-vector
  coverage, display-gamut certification or Dolby Vision support. See the
  [testing guide](docs-book/part-2-developer-guide/testing.md) for the measured cases.
- Native codec acceptance remains conditional on the selected release path.
  [AAC reference coverage](packages/codecs/baander-aac/docs/README.md) does not
  exercise the 34-band and phase decoder paths; listening tests and the HE-AAC
  IPC/bridge suites were not run in that checkpoint. The original 5% HE-AAC CBR
  target was not established by the delivered 6% acceptance gate. These limits
  do not select unused codec work or reopen intentional encoder design decisions.
- Other existing limits belong in the [scan guide](docs-book/part-1-operator-guide/commands/app-library-scan.md),
  [Transcode context](docs-book/part-2-developer-guide/contexts/transcode.md) and
  [messaging guide](docs-book/part-2-developer-guide/cqrs-and-messaging.md).
  Delivered directory publication does not complete the broader event-producer
  transaction-boundary audit. None of these boundaries selects a new task here.

## Registry release acceptance

The [Registry guide](relay/README.md) documents implemented contracts, deployment,
encrypted backup and recovery, packaged dependency inventory, and existing
qualification runners. Its [release acceptance](relay/README.md#release-acceptance)
section retains the full whole-host budgets and workload thresholds.

- **Constrained deployment:** qualify the agreed five-host optimized profile,
  including snapshots, compaction, catch-up and backup upload. Each whole host has
  1 CPU and 512 MiB; API-container limits and short local load smoke do not establish
  whole-host acceptance. Supply target hosts or an explicitly agreed equivalent
  measurement environment before selecting this work. Sanitizer workers may be larger.
- **Performance baseline:** select a stable runner and accepted baseline, then add
  comparison enforcing confirmed regressions above 10%. Existing bounded smoke
  measurements do not establish that baseline.
- **Long soak:** reserve a 24-hour workload window on the intended deployment
  profile. After warm-up, compare equivalent quiescent windows; fail sustained RSS
  growth over 1 MiB/hour or 10% of baseline.
- **Destination recovery:** qualify encrypted, versioned five-minute S3-compatible
  backups at the actual destination and rehearse isolated restoration with a
  five-minute RPO and 30-minute RTO. Disposable TLS S3 upload and offline restore
  are covered; actual-destination access is unavailable.
- **Regional deployment:** obtain access and inventory for `de`, `ca`, `sg`, `au`
  and `fi` (unavailable, user confirmed 2026-10-04). Validate the actual five-voter
  topology, rolling upgrades preserving volumes and bootstrap guards, no
  acknowledged-data loss after two-voter failure, and leader recovery within
  30 seconds. Region names alone do not supply deployment access.

The nightly workflow is on the default branch and locally verified. Hosted
scheduler activation and a scheduled run are not verified by the evidence here.
Use the documented
[nightly procedure](relay/README.md#nightly-qualification-and-retained-diagnostics)
when checking that deployment decision.

## Application release acceptance

- **Recovery:** rehearse application backup restoration before migration rollout.
  Follow the [upgrade guide](docs-book/part-1-operator-guide/upgrading.md); this
  prerequisite does not reopen covered fresh-install or migration behavior.
- **Redistribution:** resolve the application's observed notice, provenance and
  embedded-dependency gaps before qualifying a release image. The
  [application review record](third_party/inventory/application-review.md) retains
  the inventory evidence and verification checkpoint; follow the
  [collection procedure](dev-docs/application-packaged-inventory.md) for each new
  artifact. Preserve the boundaries in [THIRD_PARTY.md](THIRD_PARTY.md).
  The separate Registry inventory is outside this remainder.
- **Selected native media path:** when a release explicitly includes an active
  codec/DSP path, resolve its remaining reproducibility and reference-vector
  acceptance before claiming certification. Use the
  [DSP qualification guide](packages/dsp/README.md) to identify the current evidence
  and limits. Browser graph checks alone do not certify native codec behavior;
  an unwired module's incomplete qualification does not create a release task.
- **First production release:** record acceptance evidence before cutting it.
  There are no production deployments. Remove the temporary pre-release policy in
  [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) only when the user explicitly announces the first release;
  a tag, build or deployment preparation does not make that announcement.

## Deferred scope

React Native and Android remain deferred at the user's request (2026-10-05).
Resume their feature, API and tooling reconciliation only when the user resumes
that work. Historical mobile failures do not select a task or a new CI lane.

## Completed work and evidence

The complete pre-cleanup roadmap is preserved at
`f31c3ef3ff10fc9f7fe9b7c472bf1c9e4a3ad2e0`. Read it with
`git show f31c3ef3ff10fc9f7fe9b7c472bf1c9e4a3ad2e0:ROADMAP.md` for historical
suite counts, failed attempts, source revisions and receipt paths. Completed
checkpoints are omitted here; their earlier failed stages do not reopen work
closed by later evidence.

Implemented plans remain recoverable at
`ef388275de15f5d63af5a7bb1a056ccf20183841`. List them with
`git ls-tree --name-only ef388275de15f5d63af5a7bb1a056ccf20183841 docs/plans/`,
then read one with `git show ef388275de15f5d63af5a7bb1a056ccf20183841:<path>`.
The six remaining plans contain unfinished or partly superseded commitments;
their retention does not resume deferred work or validate historical assumptions.

The entries below preserve the installation guides' linked checkpoint and a
compact record of delivered status reconciliation.

### Source-installation documentation

Disposable installation verified frontend loading, administrator login, worker
admission, sample music ingestion and catalog display. Original FLAC and transcoded
Opus played to completion, with exact byte-range delivery. The final repair passed
307 focused unit/native tests and 53 affected service/functional tests; PHPStan,
Deptrac and cleanup checks passed. These are historical results, not new checks.

The installation used a named checkout volume for the remote Docker daemon,
a supported controller container for host PHP extensions, an accepted disposable
self-signed certificate and internal networks. It did not qualify the literal
host-PHP procedure, external metadata providers, other media workflows or host
hardware. The [source-installation guide](docs-book/part-1-operator-guide/getting-started.md)
contains the current procedure; the pinned history above retains detailed evidence
and environment adaptations.

### Pause and resume after uncertain delivery — 2026-10-24

Status reconciliation was delivered with 169 tests across four frontend suites
and all eight production browser phases passing. The
[testing guide](docs-book/part-2-developer-guide/testing.md) describes current
verification; the historical contract remains in Git. Evidence remains under
`var/test-runs/player-status-outage-gates` and
`var/test-runs/player-status-outage-production-accepted`; the pinned history
retains failed attempts and acceptance limits. This completed checkpoint does
not select more outage work.

## Roadmap maintenance

Cleanup, 2026-10-26: removed completed checkpoint narratives and superseded
follow-ups while preserving unresolved scope, release budgets and incoming links.
The full history remains at the pinned revision above. The first cleanup verified
26 local links and three incoming anchor references; release gates and deferred
scope were preserved, and prose audits and whitespace checks passed.

Plan cleanup, 2026-10-26: retired 36 delivered plans, including stale completion
labels and this cleanup's own plan. Six unfinished or partly superseded July plans
remain byte-identical. Repaired all five incoming references to retired plans and
retained the AAC bitrate acceptance gap. Completed history remains recoverable
from the pinned revisions. All 36 local links in the two edited documents and
three incoming roadmap anchors resolve; no surviving file references a deleted
plan. Hash checks, prose audits, independent review and whitespace checks passed.
No application code changed or application suites ran.
